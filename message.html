        <h1>I'm pretty bad with long text message, but it's necessary yk</h1><br>
        <h2>First of all, happy birthday</h2><br>
        <p>I probably ask u (or u haven't proposed which would have been good) to let u alone reading that, i would have been a been cringed by the whole thing, so it'll be probably more a dialogue than a basic happy birthday letter<br>
            I'm glad to still talk to you, and if that's not an enough proof to show that i care about you and wish to see the next year with you near, i don't know what is <br> We've gone throught weird things and will still go but thats how i like us.
            <br><br>Only been 1 year but i feel a lot happend somehow ? Not the "ah it feels like we know eachtoher since forever" but more like "i feel like i've been through a lot with you" and that's cool ngl <br>
            <br><br> Except that, hoping you'll become better at texting wtf ? A year u have this excuse, you should change the disk my guy... (yes idc i tell whatever i want here) <br>
            <br><br>
            How's 19 ? you like that number ? I think it's pretty cool...<br>
            You old af tho now, should i call you granny ? mommy ? idk i'll figure it out after some time<br>
            I can't do anything else but wishing you the best life, the best decision, the best year of your life since it started. There's no reason it won't go the other way seeing how you evolve. <br> For the better. <br>

            Anyway ur probably busy with sm phone call since ur a GIRL, so happy birthday, if u haven't seen ur "GIFT ????" you should check it (pretty noice)<br>
            and have a good life idk just gtfo  <br><br>(don't expect that to every birthday...)<br><br> :3
